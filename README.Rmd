This package provides functions and a shiny application to simulate inter-rater 
reliability statistics based on various scoring and response models. The initial motivation for 
this package is to understand the relationship between percent rater agreement and intraclass correlation.

Documentation is available at http://irrsim.bryer.org

Slides for NCME 2019 talk are here: <a href="http://irrsim.bryer.org/IRRsim-Presentation.html" target="_blank">http://irrsim.bryer.org/IRRsim-Presentation.html</a>

## Install

The development version of `IRRsim` can be downloaded from Github using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github('jbryer/IRRsim')
```

## Shiny App

Many of features of this package can be explored using the included shiny applications. The `IRRsim_shiny()` function will run the application.

```r
IRRsim::IRRsim_demo()
```

## Data

The analysis done in the vignette requires a large number of simulated datasets. Not only does it take a long time for those datasets to be generated, the file sizes exceed what is allowed in R packages. The data are stored as [Github releases](https://github.com/jbryer/IRRsim/releases/tag/IRRsimData). See the [data-releases/IRRsimulations.R](data-releases/IRRsimulations.R) R script for how these data files are generated. Alternatively, you can download the data using the following commands in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download_dir <- getwd()
download.file('https://github.com/jbryer/IRRsim/releases/download/IRRsimData/IRRsimData.rda', 
			  paste0(download_dir, '/IRRsimData.rda'))
load(paste0(download_dir, '/IRRsimData.rda))
```
